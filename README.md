- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @apenake
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data science, statistics, and machine learning algorithms to solve real world problems.
- ðŸŒ± I recently graduated with my Master's of Science in Computational Data Analytics from Georgia Tech. This was an interdisciplinary program between the College of Engineering, the College of Computing, and the Scheller College of Business.
- :woman_technologist: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science consulting projects. I currently advise small to mid-sized companies looking to utilize data analytics to unlock deep quantitative insights throughout their business. I've done most of my work in predictive analytics and specialize in making complex concepts accessible and engaging.
